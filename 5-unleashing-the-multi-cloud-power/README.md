# Unleashing the multi-cloud power

## Goals

* Learn about Event Gateway System Events
* Work with a CRUD user app
* Integrate the Event Gateway with a fully-fledged frontend application
* Use Google services such as BigQuery and the CloudVision API

## Instructions

### The Event Gateway Playground

In this chapter we'll use the Event Gateway Playground project which is a slightly modified version of the [`event-gateway-example` project](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway-example).

This project includes a variety of different example services to showcase various use-cases you can accomplish with the Event Gateway.

### Project setup

Switch to the `event-gateway-playground` directory by running `cd event-gateway-playground`.

Install the dependencies by running `npm install` and `npm run setup`.

### Exploring the Event Gateway Playground

Open up the `event-gateway-example` repositories ["Step-by-step guide"](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway-example#step-by-step-guide) and follow along.

In this guide you'll see how you can implement error-handling with the help of the Event Gateways System Events, how you can integrate a frontend with your Event-Gateway based backend and how Google CloudVision and Google BigQuery can be used to analyze user profile pictures and track your users behavior.

**Note:** When working through the guide keep in mind that there's a `frontend` directory which includes the webapp for the Event Gateway Playground! Watch the Event Gateways terminal output when interacting with it.
